# Where am I at?

In gatsby-config.js, I added some plugin configurations, so that:

- the posts folder in src can work as a page folder (where gatsby looks for pages by default), so Gatsby can find them and load them to GraphQL
- the file in the pages folder (blog posts) can be turned into pages with their own address that matches the name of the file
- plain old files can be changed into MDX node

I am currently working to apply my Layout component to all of my blog posts. I tried configuring the gatsby-plugin-mdx in gatsby-config.js, 
but realize defaultLayouts is removed since version 3 (I'm on version 5). As I'm doing this, I wonder if I should make a template for my blogs.
